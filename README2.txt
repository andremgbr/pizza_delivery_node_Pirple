I would make this API much better, make it clean, make it more smart(like make wokers to make the payment, some console.log
to show all the status,cleaning files, make a order separeted of payment commando ) and etc., but I don't have too much free time,
I just want to make the API enough to pass the test, and I hope that I passed!
