This is the temp email that I've created to make a Mailgun API, u can enter to see the inbox.
URL temp email (wivayev194@zcai55.com)

((First of all, I'm not english speaker, so I'll make so written mistake.))



This API was done for HomeWork Assignment #5.

To accomplish the task u should.

run the file index (node index.js) into the console.

CLI COMMNADS...

list menu ----- 1. View all the current menu items 

list orders ----- 2. View all the recent orders in the system (orders placed in the last 24 hours) 

list order --{id} ----- 3. Lookup the details of a specific order by order ID

list users ----- 4. View all the users who have signed up in the last 24 hours

list users --{id} ----- 5. Lookup the details of a specific user by email address
OBS: I used ID because of e-mail Mailgun API problem, because I just can use one e-mail to make oerders (wivayev194@zcai55.com).





I would make this API much better, make it clean, make it more smart(like make wokers to make the payment, some console.log
to show all the status,cleaning files, make a order separeted of payment commando ) and etc., but I don't have too much free time,
I just want to make the API enough to pass the test, and I hope that I passed!
